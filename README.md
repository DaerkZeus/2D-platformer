# 2D-platformer
This project is the start of a 2D platformer that features all the basic movements and animations for the base layout of a game. Developed with Unity, the files are generic and allows for further development that can easily be modified for a better experience.

The project contains all the scripts in C# used within the Unity engine. A look of the final product can be seen on: https://darkzeus.itch.io/the-kings-journey-demo. The other components of my project, such as the music or animations, do not belong to me but the scripts can easily be transferred to other graphics, music or animations.
